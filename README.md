# Announcement

We are very welcome to your contribution. Please feel free to reach out to us with your feedback and suggestions on how to improve the current models.

# Publication

This public repository contains MATLAB codes and Python notebooks for developing and simulating different steady-state and dynamic MCNNs for nonlinear 
chemical systems using noisy transient data. The corresponding publication for this work is:

**Mukherjee, A.** & Bhattacharyya, D. "*On the Development of Steady-State and Dynamic Mass-Constrained Neural Networks Using Noisy Transient Data*". 
Comput. Chem. Eng. (Under Review)

These codes will be updated in subsequent versions to enhance robustness of the proposed algorithms and user friendliness.
