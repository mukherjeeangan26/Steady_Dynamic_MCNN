## Steady-State MCNN Implementation

The files uploaded in this public repository contain codes for solving the inverse and forward problems with respect to steady-state MCNNs under all types 
of error characterizations discussed in the paper. 

Note that before running the MATLAB (.m) files, the user needs to install OPTI from https://github.com/jonathancurrie/OPTI and run the installation file. The algorithms
discussed here are generic and can be applied to any steady-state system for exact conservation of mass. For the Python notebooks (.ipynb), the user can follow the installation
instructions on the home (main) page of this repository to install idaes extensions package. 

For more details on the respective algorithms and formulations, please refer to the following publication:

Avaiable online at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2024.108722

These codes will be updated in subsequent versions to enhance user friendliness and efficiency.
