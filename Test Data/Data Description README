The excel spreadsheets provided here include steady-state and dynamic datasets for developing the MCNN model of the 
isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system using different types of noise characterizations in 
training data.

**Steady State CSTR Data**

This spreadsheet contains steady-state input-output datasets for the CSTR system. The model inputs are represented
